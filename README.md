## CornHole

### Project Description:

Design and implementation of cornhole. The code uses MATLABâ€™s ability to graph and calculate different trigonometric operations to simulate the game of cornhole. The user will be asked to input two values at the command window. The first value will be the speed at which you wish to throw the bag and the second input will be at which angle do you wish to throw the bag. After both inputs are given, MATLAB will plot the path of the bag and determine if the bag has landed inside the cornhole. After each try, the program will ask if you wish to try again. 

### Run the project:
